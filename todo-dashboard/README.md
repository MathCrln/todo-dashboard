## Versions Log

1.0.3 (17/03/2019) : Introducing Dark Mode!
---
- [x] Previously introduced, the Dark Mode is now fully functional. Let me know what you think!
- [x] The app is also fully responsive on mobile now,
- [x] Plus a lot  of bugs fixed (margins, grid system, etc).


1.0.2 (15/03/2019)
---
- [x] Translated some parts of the code and texts,
- [x] Added a hover effect (::before) to the nav,
- [x] Re-coded the left-menu with flex (now it's better centered and works better with the other items),
- [x] Re-coded the whole stylesheet using scss (now it's clearer and more "readable),
- [x] Reorganized spacings and font, everything should be symetric and well spaced by now,
- [x] Added footer signature,
- [x] Made the site responsive on mobile (under 650px),
- [x] Drafted the basis of dark mode — click on the moon to try (the color theme is not accurate just yet, but it works!),
- [x] Desactivated the left-menu on mobile temporarily (so I can make it fully responsive later).
